### Hi there, I'm Ed ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from the UK who has worked in Japan, London and Manchester. I build web and desktop apps with React, TypeScript, C#, .NET and others.

Some of my more interesting projects:

### Core Admin

[![Core Admin Readme Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=edandersen&repo=core-admin)](https://github.com/edandersen/coreadmin)

A fully fledged admin site generator for .NET Core. Add one line of code to your Startup.cs or Minimal API Program.cs and get data grids, CRUD screens, validation, file uploads, searching etc of all your database entities.

Using .NET 6 it is possible to write cross platform Desktop and Web apps without using MAUI. This repo shows you how.
